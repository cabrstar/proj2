# proj2
Carter Starr and Robert Berkley worked together on this project, which is essentially just a library of functions for manipulation of trees and strings. 

The files we coded are p2.cpp and p2-tests.cpp. The rest is starter code and/or defined libraries, classes, functions, or abstraction that was given to us for the project.

This was for EECS 280 at University of Michigan in fall of 2015. This code is NOT to be used for other students on a similar project.
